**Author:** Brandon   
**Course:** Applied Machine Learning  
**Date:** Fall 2025  

This project uses regression modeling techniques to predict medical insurance charges based on demographic and health-related features such as age, BMI, region, smoking status, and number of children.  
The notebook walks through a complete ML workflow: data loading, exploration, cleaning, encoding, feature engineering, model training, pipelines, and performance comparison.
